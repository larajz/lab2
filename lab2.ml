(* Objective:

This lab is intended to introduce you to staples of functional
programming in OCaml, including:

    lists and tuples
    higher-order functional programming
 *)

(*======================================================================
Part 1: Types and type inference beyond atomic types

Exercise 1: What are appropriate types to replace the ??? in the
expressions below? Test your solution by uncommenting the examples
(removing the `(*` and `*)` at start and end) and verifying that no
typing error is generated.
......................................................................*)

(*   <--- remove this start of comment line

let exercise1a : ??? =
  (0.1, "hi") ;;

let exercise1b : ??? =
  let add_to_hello_list x = ["Hello"; x]
  in add_to_hello_list "World!";;

let exercise1c : ???  =
  fun (x, y) -> x + int_of_float y ;;

let exercise1d : ??? =
  fun lst ->
    match lst with
    | [] -> false
    | hd :: _ -> hd < hd + 1 ;;

let exercise1e : ??? =
  fun x -> if x then [x] else [] ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 2: Update each expression below by changing the 0 in the last
line so that it evaluates to `true`.
......................................................................*)

let exercise2a =
  let lst = [1; 2; 3; 4] in
  let value = 
    match lst with
    | [] -> 0 
    | [h] -> h
    | h1 :: h2 :: t -> h2 in
  value = 0 ;;

let exercise2b =
  let x, y, z = 4, [1; 3], true in
  let value =
    match y with
    | [] -> 0
    | h :: t -> h in
  value = 0 ;;

let exercise2c =
  let tuple_lst = [(1, 4); (5, 2)] in
  let value =
    match tuple_lst with
    | [] -> 0
    | (a, b) :: t -> a
    | h1 :: (a, b) :: t -> a in
  value = 0 ;;

let exercise2d =
  let tuple_lst = [(1, 4); (5, 2)] in
  let value =
    match tuple_lst with
    | [] -> 0
    | h1 :: (a, b) :: t -> a
    | (a, b) :: t -> a in
  value = 0 ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 3: Complete the following definition for a function
`third_element` that returns a `bool * int` pair, whose first element
represents whether or not its list argument has a third element, and
whose second element represents that element if it exists (or 0 if it
does not).
......................................................................*)

let third_element (lst : int list) : bool * int =
  match lst with
  | _ -> false, 0

(*======================================================================
Part 2: First-order functional programming with lists

We'll start with some "finger exercises" defining simple functions
before moving on to more complex problems. As a reminder, here's the
definition for the length function of type `int list -> int`:

    let rec length (lst : int list) : int =
      match lst with
      | [] -> 0
      | head :: tail -> 1 + length tail ;;

........................................................................
Exercise 4: In lab 1, we defined a function that could square its
input. Now, define a function `square_all` that squares all of the
elements of an integer list. We've provided a bit of template code,
supplying the first line of the function definition but the body of
the skeleton code just causes a failure by forcing an error using the
built-in `failwith` function. Edit the code to implement `square_all`
properly.

Test out your implementation of `square_all` by modifying the template
code below to define `exercise2` to be the `square_all` function
applied to the list containing the elements `3`, `4`, and `5`. You'll
want to replace the `[]` with the correct functional call.

Thorough testing is important in all your work, and we hope to impart
this view to you in CS51. Testing will help you find bugs, avoid
mistakes, and teach you the value of short, clear functions. In the
file lab2_tests.ml, we've put some prewritten tests for `square_all`
using the testing method of Section 6.5 in the book. Spend some time
understanding how the testing function works and why these tests are
comprehensive. You may want to add some tests for other functions in
the lab to get some practice with automated unit testing.
......................................................................*)

let square_all (lst : int list) : int list =
  failwith "square_all not implemented" ;;

let exercise4 = [] ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 5: Define a recursive function `sum` that sums the values in
its integer list argument. (What's a sensible return value for the sum
of the empty list?)
......................................................................*)

let sum (lst : int list) : int =
  failwith "sum not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 6: Define a recursive function `max_list` that returns the
maximum element in a non-empty integer list. Don't worry what happens
on an empty list. You may be warned by the compiler that "this
pattern-matching is not exhaustive." You may ignore this warning for
this lab.
......................................................................*)

let max_list (lst : int list) : int =
  failwith "max_list not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 7: Define a function `zip`, that takes two `int list`
arguments and returns a list of pairs of ints, one from each of the
two argument lists. Your function can assume the input lists will be
the same length. You can ignore what happens in the case the input
list lengths do not match. You may be warned by the compiler that
"this pattern-matching is not exhaustive." You may ignore this warning
for this lab.

For example,

   # zip [1; 2; 3] [4; 5; 6] ;;
   - : (int * int) list = [(1, 4); (2, 5); (3, 6)]

To think about: Why wouldn't it be possible, in cases of mismatched
length lists, to just pad the shorter list with, say, false values, so
that, zip [1] [2; 3; 4] = [(1, 2); (false, 3); (false, 4)]?
......................................................................*)

let zip (x : int list) (y : int list) : (int * int) list =
  failwith "zip not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 8: Recall from Chapter 7 the definition of the function `prods`
(duplicated below).

Using `sum`, `prods`, and `zip`, define a function `dotprod` that
takes the dot product of two integer lists (that is, the sum of the
products of corresponding elements of the lists). For example, you
should have:

    # dotprod [1; 2; 3] [0; 1; 2] ;;
    - : int = 8
    # dotprod [1; 2] [5; 10] ;;
    - : int = 25

Even without looking at the code for the functions, carefully looking
at the type signatures for `zip`, `prods`, and `sum` should give a
good idea of how you might combine these functions to implement
`dotproduct`.

If you've got the right idea, your implementation should be literally
a single line of code. If it isn't, try it again, getting into the
functional programming zen mindset.
......................................................................*)

let rec prods (lst : (int * int) list) : int list =
  match lst with
  | [] -> []
  | (x, y) :: tail -> (x * y) :: (prods tail) ;;

let dotprod (a : int list) (b : int list) : int =
  failwith "dotprod not implemented" ;;

(*======================================================================
Part 3: Higher-order functional programming with map, filter, and fold

In these exercises, you should use the built-in functions `map`,
`filter`, and `fold_left` and `fold_right` provided in the OCaml List
module to implement these simple functions.

IMPORTANT NOTE 1: When you make use of these functions, you'll either
need to prefix them with the module name, for example, `List.map` or
`List.fold_left`, or you'll need to open the `List` module with the
line

    open List ;;

You can place that line at the top of this file if you'd like.

IMPORTANT NOTE 2: In these labs, and in the problem sets as well,
we'll often supply some skeleton code that looks like this:

    let somefunction (arg1 : type) (arg2 : type) : returntype =
      failwith "somefunction not implemented"

We provide this to give you an idea of the function's intended name,
its arguments and their types, and the return type. But there's no
need to slavishly follow that particular way of implementing code to
those specifications. In particular, you may want to modify the first
line to introduce, say, a `rec` keyword (if your function is to be
recursive):

    let rec somefunction (arg1 : type) (arg2 : type) : returntype =
      ...your further code here...

Or you might want to define the function using anonymous function
syntax. (If you haven't seen this yet, come back to this comment later
when you have.)

    let somefunction =
      fun (arg1 : type) (arg2 : type) : returntype ->
        ...your further code here...

This will be especially pertinent in this section, where functions can
be built just by applying other higher order functions directly,
without specifying the arguments explicitly, for example, in this
implementation of the `double_all` function, which doubles each
element of a list:

    let double_all : int list -> int list =
      map (( * ) 2) ;;

END IMPORTANT NOTES

........................................................................
Exercise 9: Reimplement `sum` using `fold_left`, naming it `sum_ho`
(for "higher order").
......................................................................*)

let sum_ho (lst : int list) : int =
  failwith "sum_ho not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 10: Reimplement prods : `(int * int) list -> int list` using
the `map` function.
......................................................................*)

let prods_ho (lst : (int * int) list) : int list =
  failwith "prods_ho not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 11: The OCaml List module provides -- in addition to the `map`,
`fold_left`, and `fold_right` higher-order functions -- several other
useful higher-order list manipulation functions. For instance, `map2` is
like `map`, but takes two lists instead of one along with a function of
two arguments and applies the function to corresponding elements of the
two lists to form the result list. (You can read about it at
https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/List.html#VALmap2.)
Use `map2` to reimplement `zip` and call it `zip_ho`.
......................................................................*)

let zip_ho (x : int list) (y : int list) : (int * int) list =
  failwith "zip_ho not implemented" ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 12: Define a function `evens`, using these higher-order
functional programming techniques, that returns a list of all of the
even numbers in its argument list.
......................................................................*)

let evens : int list -> int list =
  fun _ -> failwith "evens not implemented" ;;
